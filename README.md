# Arduino Post Values

Program that sends sensors values from an Arduino board to an RESTful API.

## About

This is an example of how to send values from sensors connected to an Arduino board to a web application through a RESTful API. For this example, I used a very simple web application that I made for sampling purpose (you could find it [here](https://github.com/dreamingechoes/sensors_admin_panel)).

It uses an **ENC28J60 Ethernet** chip and a **DHT11 Temperature and humidity** sensor.
